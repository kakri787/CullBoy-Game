# Cull Boy Game
Play as a cowboy to cull enemies with your trusty sidearm.

## Info
I made this game using lua and love2d game framework. All sprites were drawn and animated by me, myself and I. <br>
This game project helped me to learn the basics of game design and the use of object oriented programming to create functions for the player and enemies. <br>
Additionally, I learnt to draw and animate my own sprites which required me to design the visuals myself rather than use sprites provided online.
